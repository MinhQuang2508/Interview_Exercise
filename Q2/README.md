# Triplet Loss Implementation

## Introduction

This repository contains explanations and implementations of the Triplet Loss function, used in deep learning for metric learning. Triplet Loss helps in learning embeddings where distances between points of the same class are minimized and distances between points of different classes are maximized.

## a. Triplet Loss

### Mathematical Formula

The Triplet Loss function is defined as:

\[ L(a, p, n) = \max \left(0, \|a - p\|^2 - \|a - n\|^2 + \alpha \right) \]


Where:
- \(a\) is the anchor point.
- \(p\) is the positive point.
- \(n\) is the negative point.
- \(d(\cdot, \cdot)\) denotes the Euclidean distance.
- \(\alpha\) is the margin.

### Explanation

- **Anchor Point**: The reference point in the embedding space.
- **Positive Point**: A point of the same class as the anchor.
- **Negative Point**: A point of a different class from the anchor.
- **Margin (\(\alpha\))**: Ensures that the distance between the anchor and the positive point is smaller than the distance between the anchor and the negative point by at least \(\alpha\).

## b. Triplet Loss with Multiple Negatives

### Mathematical Formula

When there are multiple negative samples, the Triplet Loss function is extended to:

\[ L(a, p, \{n_i\}_{i=1}^k) = \sum_{i=1}^k \max \left(0, \|a - p\|^2 - \|a - n_i\|^2 + \alpha \right) \]


Where:
- \(\{n_i\}_{i=1}^M\) represents the set of negative samples.

### Explanation

- **Multiple Negatives**: Instead of a single negative point, the model considers multiple negative points.
- **Maximum Loss**: The loss is computed for each negative sample, and the maximum value is used to ensure the anchor is correctly distinguished from all negative samples.
- **Purpose**: This approach helps in making the model more robust by learning to separate the anchor from several negative samples rather than just one.
